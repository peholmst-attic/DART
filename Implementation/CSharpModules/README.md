DART C# Modules
===============

This directory contains the code for the parts of DART that are implemented in C#/.NET.

I've never written a single line of C# before and since DART is first and foremost a personal excercise project, I decided to implement the backend in C# in order to learn it.

For those of you C# gurus who are reading the code, remember this is C# written by a Java developer.
